        Short explanation of what you were going to do, what did you want to accomplish?

        I tried to brew a coffee with ASF using `PUT /Api/Coffee` ASF API endpoint, but upon trying the program returned HTTP error: 418 I'm a teapot.

        What happened instead?

        No coffee was brewed, and so I was forced to use a water dispenser instead :/.

        Every command or action that happened after launching ASF, which leads to the bug.
        If launching ASF with provided configs (below) is everything that is needed, then this section is not mandatory.
        Screenshots of the problem and/or steps leading to it could be very useful in particular.
      placeholder: |
        1. Put cup below the machine hosting ASF.
        2. Send `PUT /Api/Coffee` request selecting latte macchiato.
        3. No coffee was brewed.

      label: Possible reason/solution
      description: |
        Not mandatory, but you can suggest a fix/reason for the bug, if known to you.
        If you observed something peculiar about your issue that could help us locate and fix the culprit, this is the right place.
      placeholder: |
        Perhaps no coffee was brewed because I was out of milk?
  - type: textarea
    id: asf-log
    attributes:
      label: Full log.txt recorded during reproducing the problem
      description: |
        You can find `log.txt` file directly in ASF directory.
        If the bug report doesn't come from the last run of the program, you can find logs from previous runs of the program in the `logs` directory instead.
        If no `log.txt` was recorded due to crash at the very early stage, console output should be pasted instead.

        The config can be found in `config` directory under `ASF.json` name.
        You can leave this field empty if not using one.

        Ensure that your config has redacted (but NOT removed) potentially-sensitive properties, such as:
        - IPCPassword (recommended)
        - LicenseID (mandatory)
        - SteamOwnerID (optionally)
        - WebProxy (optionally, if exposing private details)
        - WebProxyPassword (optionally, if exposing private details)
        - WebProxyUsername (optionally, if exposing private details)

        Redacting involves replacing sensitive details, for example with stars (***). You should refrain from removing config lines entirely, as their pure existence may be relevant and should be preserved.
